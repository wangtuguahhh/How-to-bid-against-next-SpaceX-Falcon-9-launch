# How-to-outbid-next-SpaceX-Falcon-9-launch
This is a capstone project of [IBM data science professional certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) online program. Here is my completion [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/9af09f14707a3324143dbcd6d23bd719).
## ðŸš€ Background:
Even though this project is a requirement for my certificate completion, I genuinely enjoy working on it. It integrates the essential skills a data scientist needs to have and is closely associated with actual business challenges in the real world. 

SpaceX promotes its Falcon 9 rocket launches with a much lower cost of 62 million dollars compared to the average cost of 165 million dollars from other competitors. This cost reduction is primarily due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. If a competitor aims to outbid SpaceX for a rocket launch, the key question becomes the cost of the launch. An accurate model is needed to predict the outcome of Falcon 9 first stage landing in order to estimate the cost and make an informed decision about the bid offer. 
## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:
* Build an accurate model to predict the outcome of Falcon 9 first stage landing
* Answer the questions: 
  - How much to offer to outbid SpaceX next Falcon 9 launch?
  - What features have more impact on the first stage landing outcome?
## ðŸ›  Tools:
* Python for:
  - API data collecting and web scraping
  - Data wrangling
  - Extensive exploratory data analysis
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - Folium
    - Plotly
    - Dash
  - Machine learning model building and evaluation
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine
    - K-nearest Neighbors
    - Decision Tree
* SQL for data analysis
